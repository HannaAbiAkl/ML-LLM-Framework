# ML-LLM-Framework
A ML-LLM framework for constructing a data augmentation pipeline by LLM-prompting.

This is the official code repository for the [IRSE@FIRE 2023](https://sites.google.com/view/irse2023/home) track paper: "A ML-LLM pairing for better code comment
classification".

## Data
This directory contains two data files:
- **Seed data:** The data provided by the task organizers to train the ML models.
- **LLM-generated data:** The data generated by a LLM assistant (ChatGPT in this case) to evaluate the overall increase in model performance after data augmentation.

## Experiment
This directory contains the code for training and evaluating ML models on both the seed and LLM data. The code also contains data augmentation techniques using synthetic data.

## Results
This directory contains the official results submitted to the shared task.
